TLDR: more automation, cargo features are back, more breaking changes than ever,
increased linking flexibility.

This update breaks just about everything. It might not leave a stone unturned in
your code. It also discards a lot of technical debt from the **rgtk** times.

### Object reform has landed

Thanks to **[@EPashkin]**'s work on [gir] the [gtk] crate is largely
machine-generated now. At the time of this writing there are 155 autogenerated
modules vs 28 manual ones. This makes refactorings much easier, which brings us
to the long promised [Object reform][gtk221]:

* Unified smart pointers (see [glib docs][glib-objects]) implement dynamic casts
  and standard traits (`Clone`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Hash`).

* Extension trait suffix has changed from `Trait` to `Ext` (e.g. `ButtonTrait`
  -> `ButtonExt`).

* The APIs have become more consistent with upstream in these respects:

  - **Constructors never fail so they don't return `Option`.**

  - Generally, some parameters and return values became optional (notably
    `Label::new`, `TreeView::set_model`) while others lost the `Option` (e.g.
    `TreeView::get_selection`).

  - Spelling (e.g. `Notebook`, `WindowExt::set_position`).

  - Dialog APIs have reverted to more C-like form *for the time being*.

  We're not reverting to C conventions indiscriminately though:

* The APIs are also gradually getting Rust-yfied in these ways:

  - "Out" parameters are moved into return values. If the function returns a
    boolean, the return type becomes optional. Example from `EditableExt`:

    `fn get_selection_bounds(&self) -> Option<(i32, i32)>`

  - [Represent `i32`s that can't be negative][gtk246] (or only have special
    negative values) as `u16`, `u32` or enums. This has been done for
    `EntryBuffer`, `Notebook` and `TreeSortable`, partially done for `ListStore`
    and `TreeStore`. The above method will eventually look like:

    `fn get_selection_bounds(&self) -> Option<(u32, u32)>`

  - File names [take `T: AsRef<Path>`][gtk236] instead of `&str` now.

* Added bindings for `Application`, `ApplicationWindow`, `Gesture*`, made
  `Widget` and `Window` bindings more comprehensive.

Note that the generator is far from being complete, there is still a lot of work
to do.

### Cargo features are back

I've realized that [removing version features][no-features-post] had, on
balance, been a bad idea. The principal reason is that occasionally new
upstream versions do introduce minor breaking changes. Consequently, simply
updating the installed libraries could trigger confusing build failures.

Explicitly selecting the version avoids sudden breakage and keeps the user
conscious and in control of their project's requirements.

*   The version features have been [reintroduced][gtk248]. The baseline GTK+ version
    is 3.4, you can opt into higher versions like this:

    ~~~toml
    [dependencies.gtk]
    version = "0.0.7"
    features = ["v3_8"]
    ~~~

    or

    ~~~
    [dependencies]
    gtk = { version = "0.0.7", features = ["v3_8"] }
    ~~~

* `cairo-rs` [has got][cairo60] a non-version feature `png`.

### Other breaking improvements

* [gdk-pixbuf] has been split out from [gdk].

* Signal handlers [take the receiver by reference][gtk226-1], support [more
  specific receiver types][gtk226-2], and [use][gtk244] [safe][gdk95] [event
  bindings][gdk107].

* New [`Error`] and [`Value`] bindings.

* `ListStore` and `TreeStore` `insert` and `set` APIs take advantage of new
  `ToValue` trait to support setting several cells of a row at once.

* Import `gtk::prelude::*` to get all `gtk` and `glib` extension traits.
  `cairo`, `gdk-pixbuf` and `gdk` have their own preludes you should import if
  you use those crates.

### Documentation

Last year we had to exile the API docs into the appropriately licensed
[lgpl-docs] repo. [@GuillaumeGomez] has since taught [rustdoc-stripper] to put
them back: you can embed the documentation into your local copy of the crates
via the [embed-lgpl-docs feature][gtk245].

The documentation in the `lgpl-docs` repo is (for all crates but `cairo`)
exclusively generated from upstream at this time. The upstream documentation was
written in the C context so some bits won't make sense for Rust. Correcting such
bits is going to be our next documentation milestone.

### Linking

* Although the sys crates attempt to use `pkg-config` by default, if it's not
  found the build proceeds expecting the linker to find them in the default
  search path.

* Setting the `GTK_LIB_DIR` env variable bypasses `pkg-config` altogether,
  adding its value to the search path and using [hard-coded][gtk-sys-libs]
  library names.

* On Windows as a work-around for the `cannot find -limm32` issue the list of
  library names is always hardcoded even if `pkg-config` supplies the search
  paths and version checks. **You no longer need to delete Rust's bundled
  `gcc.exe`.**

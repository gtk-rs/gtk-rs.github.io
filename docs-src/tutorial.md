# Tutorial

Here's an introduction to `Gtk-rs` crates. For the users who already know Rust and Gtk, just skip the two first parts.

## Rust and `Gtk-rs`

This part explains how to add dependencies on the `Gtk-rs` crates, depending on your needs.

[Read it here](/tuto/rust_and_gtk).

## Gnome libraries and Rust

This part explains a bit how the bindings of the Gnome libraries work in Rust.

[Read it here](/tuto/gnome_and_rust).

## Full usage of `Gtk-rs` crates

In this part we'll go deeper into the mechanisms of the `Gtk-rs` crates. If you're not sure about your Rust or Gnome libraries knowledge, we recommend you to take a look at the previous parts first.

 * [Specifying version](/tuto/version).
 * [Callbacks and closures](/tuto/closures).
 * [Upcast and downcast](/tuto/upcast_downcast).
 * [Glade](/tuto/glade).

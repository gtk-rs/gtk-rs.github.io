For general support use the GNOME Discourse or IRC/Matrix.

## Discourse

[discourse.gnome.org](https://discourse.gnome.org).

## Matrix

You can connect using: **[#rust:gnome.org][]**.

[#rust:gnome.org]: https://matrix.to/#/#rust:gnome.org

# Contact Gtk-rs developers

However, if you want to contact the `Gtk-rs` developers directly, there are multiple ways:

## IRC

Channel #rust on **irc.gimp.org** server.

## Github

Of course, you can also just open an issue on our [repositories](https://github.com/gtk-rs) on github. However, please keep in mind that issues on `Gtk-rs` should be for bug reports or feature requests and not general support.

# Callbacks and closures

It's very common in GUI libraries to have callbacks (or equivalent) in order to perform an action when a specific event happens. Let's see how you can do it with `Gtk-rs`.

## Closures!

Closures, unlike functions-pointer, keep their environment, which is very useful to not have to send any argument you need into it. However, a closure's lifetime is difficult to track. In `Gtk-rs`, it requires a `static` lifetime to be **_sure_** that any objects captured by the closure will still be alive, whatever the moment the closure is invoked.

Now that you have all information, let's take a look to an example:

In C, youll write:

```C
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

void callback_clicked(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data) {
    gtk_button_set_label(GTK_BUTTON(widget), "Window");
}

GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_label("Click me!");
g_signal_connect(button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK(callback_clicked), NULL);
```

It now becomes:

```rust
use gtk::{Button, ButtonExt};

let button = Button::with_label("Click me!");
button.connect_clicked(|but| {
    but.set_label("I've been clicked!");
});
```

As simple as that! Now comes the less funny part. Let's say you want to update another widget when the button is clicked and use it after:

```rust
use gtk::{Box, Button, ButtonExt, ContainerExt, WidgetExt};

// First we create a layout.
let container = Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, 5);
// the label which will be modified inside the closure.
let label = gtk::Label::new("");
let button = Button::with_label("Click me!");
button.connect_clicked(move |_| {
    label.set_label("Button has been clicked!");
});

container.add(&button);
container.add(&label);
```

If you try to compile this code, you'll get the following error:

```
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `label`
```

To make it work, just clone label before sending it into the closure:

```rust
use gtk::{Box, Button, ButtonExt, ContainerExt, WidgetExt};

// First we create a layout.
let container = Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, 5);
// the label which will be modified inside the closure.
let label = gtk::Label::new("");
let button = Button::with_label("Click me!");
// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
let label_clone = label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(move |_| {
    label_clone.set_label("Button has been clicked!");
});

container.add(&button);
container.add(&label);
```

Now it works, as simple as that! Remember: cloning a `Gtk-rs` object only costs a pointer copy, so it's not a problem.

## Using non-`Gtk-rs` object into a `Gtk-rs` closure

That's where things get a bit more complicated. Let's say you want to write a multi-window program and want to keep track of your windows so you can access them from multiple closures.

One way to do it is using [`Rc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/rc/struct.Rc.html) and [`RefCell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html) structs from Rust standard library. Now let's see this into action in a short example:

```rust
use gtk::{Button, ButtonExt, Window};

use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::rc::Rc;

let windows: Rc<RefCell<HashMap<usize, Window>>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
let button = Button::with_label("Click me!");
// We copy the reference to the cell containing the hashmap.
let windows_clone = windows.clone();
button.connect_clicked(move |_| {
    // create_window functions creates a window and return the following tuple: (usize, Window).
    let (window_id, window) = create_window();
    windows_clone.borrow_mut().unwrap().insert(window_id, window);
});

 ...

another_button.connect_clicked(move |_| {
    let id_to_remove = get_id_to_remove();
    windows.borrow_mut().unwrap().remove(&id_to_remove);
});
```

A bit annoying to write. To give a simple explanation on how `Rc<RefCell<T>>` works:

 * [`Rc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/rc/struct.Rc.html) is just a reference counter, so it keeps count of the number of instances of the object it holds and then drop it and there is no more reference.
 * [`RefCell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html) is a bit more complicated. It allows to make an object mutable when/where it shouldn't. For more information, take a look at its documentation.

However, a macro can make your life a bit easier to do this (you can take a look at the code but it's not mandatory to understand how it works):

```rust
macro_rules! clone {
    (@param _) => ( _ );
    (@param $x:ident) => ( $x );
    ($($n:ident),+ => move || $body:expr) => (
        {
            $( let $n = $n.clone(); )+
            move || $body
        }
    );
    ($($n:ident),+ => move |$($p:tt),+| $body:expr) => (
        {
            $( let $n = $n.clone(); )+
            move |$(clone!(@param $p),)+| $body
        }
    );
}
```

And then you can use it as follow:

```rust
let windows: Rc<RefCell<HashMap<usize, Window>>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
button.connect_clicked(clone!(windows => move |_| {
    let (window_id, window) = create_window();
    windows.borrow_mut().unwrap().insert(window_id, window);
}));
```
